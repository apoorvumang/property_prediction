# property_prediction
Code for property prediction task https://www.aicures.mit.edu/tasks

The model is a multi-layer LSTM with a custom tokenizer for a SMILES string molecule. The aim is not to get a SOTA model but instead to get a simple baseline that ignores all graph structure information and only considers a molecule to be a 'string'

The predictions file is test_predictions.csv

More information on how to run the code will be posted soon.
